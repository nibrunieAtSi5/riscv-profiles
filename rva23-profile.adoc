= RVA23 Profile

//: This is the Preamble

[WARNING]
.This document is in the development state.
====
Do not use for implementations.  Assume everything can change.
====

== Introduction

This document captures the current proposal for the RVA23 profile
family.

RVA23 is intended to be a major release of the RISC-V Application
Processor Profiles.

== RVA23 Profiles

The RVA23 profiles are intended to be used for 64-bit application
processors that will run rich OS stacks from standard binary OS
distributions and with a substantial number of third-party binary user
applications that will be supported over a considerable length of time
in the field.  The approach is to provide a large guaranteed set of
features that can safely be exploited by third-party developers to
ship binaries that will provide a better experience across a large
number of alternative implementations over time.  It is explicitly a
non-goal of RVA23 to allow more hardware implementation flexibility by
supporting only a minimal set of features.

Only user-mode (RVA23U64) and supervisor-mode (RVA23S64) profiles are
specified in this family.

=== RVA23U64 Profile

The RVA23U64 profile specifies the ISA features available to user-mode
execution environments in 64-bit applications processors.  This is the
most important profile within the application processor family in
terms of the amount of software that targets this profile.

==== RVA23U64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVA23U64 and is little-endian.  As
per the unprivileged architecture specification, the `ecall`
instruction causes a requested trap to the execution environment.

==== RVA23U64 Mandatory Extensions

The following mandatory extensions were present in RVA22U64.

- *M* Integer multiplication and division.
- *A* Atomic instructions.
- *F* Single-precision floating-point instructions.
- *D* Double-precision floating-point instructions.
- *C* Compressed Instructions.
- *Zicsr*  CSR instructions.  These are implied by presence of F.
- *Zicntr* Base counters and timers.
- *Zihpm* Hardware performance counters.
- *Ziccif* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and
  coherence PMAs must support instruction fetch, and any instruction
  fetches of naturally aligned power-of-2 sizes up to min(ILEN,XLEN)
  (i.e., 32 bits for RVA23) are atomic.
- *Ziccrse* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must support RsrvEventual.
- *Ziccamoa* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must support AMOArithmetic.
- *Zicclsm* Misaligned loads and stores to main memory regions with both the
  cacheability and coherence PMAs must be supported.
- *Za64rs* Reservation sets are contiguous, naturally aligned, and a
   maximum of 64 bytes.
- *Zihintpause* Pause instruction.
- *Zba* Address computation.
- *Zbb* Basic bit manipulation.
- *Zbs* Single-bit instructions.
- *Zic64b* Cache blocks must be 64 bytes in size, naturally aligned in the
address space.
- *Zicbom* Cache-Block Management Operations.
- *Zicbop* Cache-Block Prefetch Operations.
- *Zicboz* Cache-Block Zero Operations.
- *Zfhmin* Half-Precision Floating-point transfer and convert.
- *Zkt* Data-independent execution time.

The following mandatory extensions are new in RVA23U64:

- *V* Vector Extension.

NOTE: V was optional in RVA22U64.

- *Zvfhmin* Vector FP16 conversion instructions.

- *Zihintntl* Non-temporal locality hints.

- *Zcb* Additional 16b compressed instructions.

- *Zfa* Additional scalar FP instructions.

- *Zawrs* Wait on reservation set.

- *Zjpm* Pointer masking (ignore high bits of addresses)

==== RVA23U64 Optional Extensions

RVA23U64 has eight profile options (Zfh, Zvkn, Zvks, Zvkg, Zvfh,
Zfbfmin, Zvfbfmin, Zvfbfwma).

The following profile option was also present in RVA22U64:

- *Zfh* Scalar Half-Precision Floating-Point (FP16).

RVA23U64 has seven new profile options (Zvfh, Zfbfmin, Zvfbfmin,
Zvfbfwma, Zvkn, Zvkg Zvks):

- *Zvfh* Vector half-precision floating-point (FP16)
- *Zfbfmin* Scalar BF16 FP conversions
- *Zvfbfmin* Vector BF16 FP conversions
- *Zvfbfwma* Vector BF16 widening mul-add

- *Zvkn* Vector Crypto NIST Algorithms.
- *Zvkg* Vector GHASH instructions.
- *Zvks* Vector Crypto ShangMi Algorithms.

NOTE: The scalar crypto extensions Zkn and Zks that were options in
RVA22 are not options in RVA23.  The goal is for both hardware and
software vendors to move to use vector crypto, as vectors are now
mandatory and vector crypto is substantially faster than scalar
crypto.

==== RVA23U64 Recommendations

Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
exceptions on attempts to execute unimplemented opcodes.

=== RVA23S64 Profile

The RVA23S64 profile specifies the ISA features available to a
supervisor-mode execution environment in 64-bit applications
processors.  RVA23S64 is based on privileged architecture version
1.13.

NOTE: Priv 1.13 is still being defined.

==== RVA23S64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVA23S64 and is little-endian.
The `ecall` instruction operates as per the unprivileged architecture
specification.  An `ecall` in user mode causes a contained trap to
supervisor mode.  An `ecall` in supervisor mode causes a requested
trap to the execution environment.

==== RVA23S64 Mandatory Extensions

The following unprivileged extensions are mandatory:

- The RVA23S64 mandatory unprivileged extensions include all the
mandatory unprivileged extensions in RVA23U64.

- *Zifencei*  Instruction-Fetch Fence.

NOTE: Zifencei is mandated as it is the only standard way to support
instruction-cache coherence in RVA23 application processors.  A new
instruction-cache coherence mechanism is under development
(tentatively named Zjid) which might be added as an option in the
future.

The following privileged extensions are mandatory:

- *Ss1p13*  Privileged Architecture version 1.13.

NOTE: Ss1p13 supersedes Ss1p12 but is not yet ratified.

The following privileged extensions were also mandatory in RVA22S64:

- *Svbare* The `satp` mode Bare must be supported.

- *Sv39* Page-Based 39-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Svade* Page-fault exceptions are raised when a page is accessed
   when A bit is clear, or written when D bit is clear.

- *Ssccptr* Main memory regions with both the cacheability and
   coherence PMAs must support hardware page-table reads.

- *Sstvecd* `stvec.MODE` must be capable of holding the value 0
  (Direct).  When `stvec.MODE=Direct`, `stvec.BASE` must be capable of
  holding any valid four-byte-aligned address.

- *Sstvala* stval must be written with the faulting virtual address
  for load, store, and instruction page-fault, access-fault, and
  misaligned exceptions, and for breakpoint exceptions other than
  those caused by execution of the EBREAK or C.EBREAK instructions.
  For illegal-instruction exceptions, stval must be written with the
  faulting instruction.

- *Sscounterenw* For any hpmcounter that is not read-only zero, the corresponding bit in scounteren must be writable.

- *Svpbmt* Page-Based Memory Types

- *Svinval* Fine-Grained Address-Translation Cache Invalidation

- *Ssu64xl* `sstatus.UXL` must be capable of holding the value 2
(i.e., UXLEN=64 must be supported).

The following are new mandatory extensions:

- *Svnapot* NAPOT Translation Contiguity

NOTE: Svnapot was optional in RVA22.

- *Sstc* supervisor-mode timer interrupts.

NOTE: Sstc was optional in RVA22.

==== RVA23S64 Optional Extensions

RVA23S64 has eight unprivileged options (Zfh, Zvkn, Zvkg, Zvks, Zvfh,
Zfbfmin, Zvfbfmin, Zvfbfwma) from RVA23U64, and six privileged options
(Sv48, Sv57, Svadu, Sscofpmf, Zkr, H).

The privileged optional extensions are:

- *Sv48* Page-Based 48-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Sv57* Page-Based 57-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Svadu* Hardware A/D bit updates.

- *Sscofpmf* Count Overflow and Mode-Based Filtering.

- *Zkr*  Entropy CSR.

The following hypervisor extension and mandates were also in RVA22S64:

- *H* The hypervisor extension.

When the hypervisor extension is implemented, the following are also mandatory:

- *Ssstateen* Supervisor-mode view of the state-enable extension.  The
   supervisor-mode (`sstateen0-3`) and hypervisor-mode (`hstateen0-3`)
   state-enable registers must be provided.

- *Shcounterenw* For any `hpmcounter` that is not read-only zero, the corresponding bit in `hcounteren` must be writable.

- *Shvstvala* `vstval` must be written in all cases described above for `stval`.

- *Shtvala* `htval` must be written with the faulting guest physical
   address in all circumstances permitted by the ISA.

- *Shvstvecd* `vstvec.MODE` must be capable of holding the value 0 (Direct).
  When `vstvec.MODE`=Direct, `vstvec.BASE` must be capable of holding
  any valid four-byte-aligned address.

- *Shvsatpa* All translation modes supported in `satp` must be supported in `vsatp`.

- *Shgatpa* For each supported virtual memory scheme SvNN supported in
  `satp`, the corresponding hgatp SvNNx4 mode must be supported.  The
  `hgatp` mode Bare must also be supported.

==== RVA23S64 Recommendations

- Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
  exceptions when attempting to execute unimplemented opcodes.
